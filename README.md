# HardlyDifficult Ethereum Contracts

A collection of reusable contracts and Javascript helpers for Ethereum.

Usage:

```bash
npm i hardlydifficult-ethereum-contracts
```

## Javascript Helpers

These helpers which will deploy contracts for testing using the exact bytecode and configuration as they have on mainnet, with the exception that you are the owner to enable privileged actions such as `mint`.

You can deploy these to Ganache or any network for testing. The scripts simply use your current web3 configuration.

Using these will give you an accurate representation of gas costs, error conditions, and any oddities to their specific implementation.

**Take a look at the [samples](samples) directory for examples**

### Tokens

 - DAI: ERC-20 with 18 decimals and a mint function
 - USDC: an upgradable ERC-20 with 6 decimals and mint and blacklist functions

Usage example: 

```javascript
const { tokens } = require("hardlydifficult-ethereum-contracts");
const from = accounts[0];

// Deploy a DAI contract for testing
const dai = await tokens.dai.deploy(web3, from);

// Mint tokens
await dai.mint(accounts[1], 100, { from });
```

### Protocols 

#### Unlock-Protocol
